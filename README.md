Welcome to our Point and Click Weatherwoman App!

This application uses the google maps api and the open weather api in order to create a clickable map that returns weather data.
You can either click on the map or use a zip code search(United States Only) to target an area and get its current weather data.
You an also click on the options for tomorrow's forcast and the day after tomorrow's forcast.

Have fun!
